# Engage-Face-Recognition
Facial Recognition App written in Golang using gocv and Azure Face API

The app registers users with a photo id.
While signing in,the scanned face of the user is matched with that of the registered photo id and the user gains authorization if there is a match.

In other words, the face of the user acts as the password for authentication, hence increasing security.
